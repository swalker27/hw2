            <h3><font color="blue">My Youth, 1987-2006</font></h3>
            <p><i>I was fortunate enough to be born in London and spent my early years traveling around Europe. We moved to San Diego when I was 7 and my parents used Thanksgiving breaks for us to see the US.</i></p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>France:</b> I was in love with France ever since I learned French in high school. The first time I saw Paris it was everything I hoped.</li>

            <p><i>I took advantage of going to college in the UK by traveling all around Europe by train and by plane.</i></p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>France:</b> Lucky that Paris is such a short train ride from London.</li>

            <p><i>After college I wanted to expand my horizons beyond Europe and the US. I started with a trip to Nepal and haven't looked back.</i></p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Nepal, India:</b> One of my favorite trips doing a Habitat for Humanity build in Pokhara, Nepal. We took a weekend hike in the Annapurnas and I had a chance to spend a couple of days in Kathmandu and 24 hours in Delhi. It was a once-in-a-lifetime trip!</li>
